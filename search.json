    "text": "News for package ‘panelPomp’\n\n\nChanges in panelPomp version 1.2.0\n\n\n\n\nChange the generic unitlogLik to unitLogLik to match camel-case style of package. The original function is deprecated in this version and will be removed in future updates.\n\n\n\n\nChanged panelPomp S4 object slot name from unit.objects to unit_objects in order to be consistent with pomp pacakge. Corresponding getter and setter methods for this slot have also been changed from unitobjects() to unit_objects().\n\n\n\n\nAdded generics shared(), shared()&lt;-, specific(), and specific()&lt;-. These generics provide convinient access to parameters of a panelPomp object, but the setter methods also allow for changing a parameter type between shared and unit-specific.\n\n\n\n\nMinor typo fixes to package and function documentation.\n\n\n\n\nChanges in panelPomp version 1.1.0.2\n\n\n\n\nAdded a type check for the params arguement of the pfilter function in order to throw more user friendly error.\n\n\n\n\nA more user friendly error is thrown when the user specifies a parameter as both shared and unit specific in the mif2 function.\n\n\n\n\nAdded a match.arg call in mif2.internal; this will allow the default option for the cooling.type argument in mif2 to no longer throw an error, and mimics the behaviour of the mif2 function in the pomp package.\n\n\n\n\nThe pParams function no longer changes the order of the unit specific parameter names; this was causing an error because the barycentric parameter transformation requires that the parameters are adjacent to one another in the parameter vector.\n\n\n\n\nImproved documentation for panel_logmeanexp.\n\n\n\n\nMore robust input checking for the pfilter function with user friendly error messages.\n\n\n\n\nChanges in panelPomp version 1.1.0\n\n\n\n\nImproved documentation and tests.\n\n\n\n\nChanges in panelPomp version 1.0.0\n\n\n\n\nSubmitted to CRAN.\n\n\n\n\nChanges in panelPomp version 0.18.0\n\n\n\n\nFixed bug in fromVectorPparams() to make it a true inverse of toVectorPparams().\n\n\n\n\nHomogenized documentation; added examples.\n\n\n\n\nChanges in panelPomp version 0.15.0\n\n\n\n\nNew coercion to pompList and update to list.\n\n\n\n\npanelGompertzLikelihood replaces kalman_gompertz.R.\n\n\n\n\nexpunged panelPompExample.\n\n\n\n\nNames added to plot; pfilter matches units by name.\n\n\n\n\nChanges in panelPomp version 0.14.0\n\n\n\n\nNew simulate function.\n\n\n\n\nChanges in panelPomp version 0.13.0\n\n\n\n\nNew panelRandomWalk example.\n\n\n\n\npanelPompExample is now deprecated and will be removed in the near future.\n\n\n\n\nChanges in panelPomp version 0.12.0\n\n\n\n\nNew plot method for panelPomp objects.\n\n\n\n\nChanges in panelPomp version 0.11.0\n\n\n\n\nAdditional functions implementing Kalman filtering to panels and to the Gompertz model.\n\n\n\n\nChanges in panelPomp version 0.10.2.0\n\n\n\n\nMinor improvements to the interface.\n\n\n\n\nAdditional examples: contacts() and panelGompertz().\n\n\n\n\nThe minimum version of pomp supported is now 2.7.\n\n\n\n\nChanges in panelPomp version 0.9.1\n\n\n\n\nThe minimum version of pomp supported is now 2.1. While this is likely to imply substantial changes in pomp objects (on which panelPomp objects rely) there are only three fundamental changes that break panelPomp’s backwards compatibility:\n\n\n\n\nThe first argument pfilter(object, …) changes to data.\n\n\n\n\nThe first argument mif2(object, …) changes to data.\n\n\n\n\nThe ‘conv.rec’ method has been deprecated, replaced by the new ‘traces’ method.\n\n\n\n\nChanges in panelPomp version 0.8.3\n\n\n\n\nImprovements to the interface.\n\n\n\n\nChanges in panelPomp version 0.7\n\n\n\n\nA new conv.rec method.\n\n\n\n\nChanges in panelPomp version 0.6\n\n\n\n\nMany improvements to the interface.\n\n\n\n\nChanges in panelPomp version 0.5.6\n\n\n\n\npanelPompExamples() now allows creating panelPomp objects that come with the package.\n\n\n\n\nNew documentation and tests.\n\n\n\n\nChanges in panelPomp version 0.5.5\n\n\n\n\nNew documentation and tests.\n\n\n\n\nChanges in panelPomp version 0.5.4\n\n\n\n\nNew documentation and tests.\n\n\n\n\nChanges in panelPomp version 0.5.3\n\n\n\n\nNew documentation and additional tests.\n\n\n\n\nChanges in panelPomp version 0.5\n\n\n\n\nNew documentation and additional tests and coverage.\n\n\n\n\nChanges in panelPomp version 0.4\n\n\n\n\nNew tests added.\n\n\n\n\nNew methods.\n\n\n\n\nA bug in pfilter and mif2 has been fixed (pomp’s default filtering tolerance tol=1e-17 was used instead of values specified by the user). Thanks to Aaron King for finding it.\n\n\n\n\nChanges in panelPomp version 0.2\n\n\n\n\nNew tests added.\n\n\n\n\nEliminate need to protect rw.sd from being evaluated.\n\n\n\n\nChanges in panelPomp version 0.1\n\n\n\n\nUnused variable purged.\n\n\n\n\npPfilter.internal streamlined.\n\n\n\n\nTest for reproducibility of pfilter calculations added."

King and Jesse Wheeler (jeswheel@umich.edu)\n\n\nInference for PanelPOMPs (Panel Partially Observed Markov Processes)\nThe panelPomp package provides facilities for inference on panel data using panel partially-observed Markov process (PanelPOMP) models. To do so, it relies on and extends a number of facilities that the pomp package provides for inference on time series data using partially-observed Markov process (POMP) models.\nThe panelPomp package extends to panel data some of the capabilities of the pomp package to fit nonlinear, non-Gaussian dynamic models. This is done accommodating both fixed and random effects. Currently, the focus is on likelihood-based approaches. In addition to these likelihood-based tools, panelPomp also provides a framework under which alternative statistical methods for PanelPOMP models can be developed (very much like pomp provides a platform upon which statistical inference methods for POMP models can be implemented).\n\n\nData analysis using panelPomp\nThe first step in using panelPomp is to encode one’s model(s) and data in objects of class panelPomp. One does this via a call to the panelPomp::panelPomp constructor function.\nThe current panelPomp version provides algorithms for\n\nparticle filtering of panel data (AKA sequential Monte Carlo or sequential importance sampling), as proposed in Bret, Ionides and King (2020). This reference provides the fundamental theoretical support for the averaging of Monte Carlo replicates of panel unit likelihoods as implemented in panelPomp; see the pfilter function documentation.\nthe panel iterated filtering method of Bret, Ionides and King (2020). This reference provides the fundamental theoretical support for the extensions of the iterated filtering ideas of Ionides et al. (2006, 2011, 2015) to panel data as implemented in panelPomp; see the mif2 function documentation.\n\nThe package also provides various tools for handling and extracting information on models and data.\n\n\nExtending the platform for developing inference tools\npanelPomp extends to panel data the general interface to the components of POMP models provided by pomp. In doing so, it contributes to the goal of the pomp project of facilitating the development of new algorithms in an environment where they can be tested and compared on a growing body of models and datasets.\n\n\nComments, bug reports, and requests\nContributions are welcome, as are suggestions for improvement, feature requests, and bug reports. Please submit these via the panelPomp issues page. We particularly welcome minimal working examples displaying uninformative, misleading or inacurate error messages. We also welcome suggestions for clarifying obscure passages in the documentation. Help requests are welcome, but please consider before sending requests whether they are regarding the use of panelPomp or that of pomp. For help with pomp, please visit pomp’s FAQ."
