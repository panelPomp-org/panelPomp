The basic idea driving panelPomp is to apply to a collection of units (or individuals) some of the pomp package facilities for implementing POMP models, simulating them, and fitting them to time series data."

To implement such models, simulate them and fit them to panel data, ‘panelPomp’ extends some of the facilities provided for time series data by the ‘pomp’ package. Implemented methods include filtering (panel particle filtering) and maximum likelihood estimation (Panel Iterated Filtering) as proposed in Breto, Ionides and King (2020) “Panel Data Analysis via Mechanistic Models” doi:10.1080/01621459.2019.1604367.\n\n\nDepends\n\n\n\n\n\ntype\npackage\nversion\n\n\n\n\nDepends\nR\n&gt;= 4.1.0\n\n\nDepends\npomp\n&gt;= 4.5.2\n\n\nImports\nmethods\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLicense\nGPL-3"
